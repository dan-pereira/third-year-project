# CA326 - Third Year Project

## Daniel Pereira & Jacob Byrne

This is our third year project, it's a timetable and attendance based system for students and lecturers.

The backend of the system is run on a server and handles authentication, parsing of DCUâ€™s timetable and the attendance handling feature.
The app handles information that is being taken from the server upon request. The options for viewing a timetable are NFC or by filling out a text field. If a student scans an NFC tag the attendance for the room that they scan will increase by one.
A lecturer can be set up on request with a username and password, which allows them to view the number of students checked into a specific room.
